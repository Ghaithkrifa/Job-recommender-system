**Job Recommender System** is a desktop application designed to help you find job and internship opportunities tailored to your profile. Using advanced artificial intelligence techniques, the application analyzes your resume, skills, and professional experiences to suggest relevant job offers.

We have developed a dynamic database that is regularly updated with the latest job postings from the three most renowned websites: LinkedIn, Welcome to the Jungle, and Glassdoor.

With this application, you no longer need to manually sift through each offer. With just a few clicks, you can access opportunities that best match your skills and interests.
